            <li>baking powder</li>

        <h2 class="header header-small">Directions:</h2>
        <ol class="o-list">
            <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl 
            and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another
            bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until
            they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over
            medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another
            few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
            <li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your
            favorite pancake toppings.</li>
